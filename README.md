# PatchProof‚Ñ¢ Authentication API ‚Äì Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
This API provides secure authentication, chain of custody, and on-chain anchoring for PatchProof‚Ñ¢ records. It is designed for production with robust error handling, modular funding, JWT-based authentication, and flexible database and secrets management.

---

## Deployment Requirements

### Database Migrations (Production)
For production, use formal database migrations to manage schema changes safely and predictably. This project uses [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) migrations:

- Migration config: `knexfile.js`
- Migration scripts: `/migrations`
- To create the database schema, run:
  ```sh
  npx knex migrate:latest
  ```
- To create a new migration:
  ```sh
  npx knex migrate:make migration_name
  ```
- To rollback:
  ```sh
  npx knex migrate:rollback
  ```

**Why?**
- Migrations provide version control for your schema, enable safe upgrades/downgrades, and are required for multi-instance or cloud deployments.
- The API no longer creates tables automatically in production; run migrations as a deployment step.

### 1. Environment Variables

#### Database
- `DB_TYPE` ‚Äì `sqlite` (default), `postgres`, or `mysql` (Postgres/MySQL are stubs)

#### Secrets Management
- All secrets are accessed via `secrets.js` abstraction. For local/dev, use environment variables. For production, use a secrets manager or HSM.
- Required secrets:
  - `MASTER_SECRET` ‚Äì Master secret for deterministic key derivation
  - `API_KEY` ‚Äì API key for admin/protected endpoints
  - `JWT_SECRET` ‚Äì JWT signing secret

#### On-Chain Anchoring (Funding Modes)

**A. Static/Manual Mode (Single UTXO, for dev/test):**
- `MERCHANT_API_URL` ‚Äì Merchant API endpoint for BSV broadcast
- `UTXO_TXID` ‚Äì Funding UTXO transaction ID
- `UTXO_OUTPUT_INDEX` ‚Äì UTXO output index (integer)
- `UTXO_SATOSHIS` ‚Äì UTXO value in satoshis
- `UTXO_SCRIPT_HEX` ‚Äì UTXO locking script in hex
- `UTXO_PRIVKEY_WIF` ‚Äì Private key (WIF) for signing
- `UTXO_CHANGE_ADDRESS` ‚Äì Address for change output (optional)

**B. Dynamic SmartLedger Wallet Mode (Recommended for Production):**
- `SMARTLEDGER_API_BASE_URL` ‚Äì e.g. `https://smartledger.dev`
- `SMARTLEDGER_API_KEY` ‚Äì Your SmartLedger API key
- `FUNDING_ADDRESS` ‚Äì BSV address to fund anchoring transactions
- `FUNDING_WIF` ‚Äì Corresponding private key (WIF) for signing

If all SmartLedger variables are set, dynamic wallet mode is used. Otherwise, static/manual mode is used as fallback.

#### Other
- `PORT` ‚Äì Port to run the API (default: 3000)

## Security & Operational Best Practices
- **Secrets:** Use a cloud secrets manager or HSM in production. Never hardcode secrets in source code or config files.
- **Key Rotation:** With dynamic funding, rotate `FUNDING_WIF` and funding addresses regularly. Multiple sources or wallet APIs can be integrated in the future.
- **JWT Expiry:** JWTs are short-lived (default 10 minutes). Adjust expiry as needed.
- **CORS:** Restrict allowed origins to trusted domains only (see below).
- **Rate Limiting:** Adjust thresholds based on expected traffic and threat model.
- **Monitoring:** Configure Winston or your preferred logger to forward logs to a central aggregation service. Optionally, add Prometheus metrics or APM.

## CORS & Rate Limiting Configuration

### CORS
By default, CORS is permissive for dev. For production, restrict origins:
```js
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://yourdomain.com',
  'https://admin.yourdomain.com'
];
app.use(cors({
  origin: (origin, cb) => {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) return cb(null, true);
    cb(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
  },
  credentials: true
}));
```

### Rate Limiting
Default is 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP. Adjust for your needs:
```js
app.use(rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100, // Tune for your traffic
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
}));
```

## üöÄ CI/CD & Automated Testing

This project includes a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Lint & Test:** Runs `npm install` and `npm test` (Jest + Supertest integration tests) on every push and pull request.
- **Database Migrations:** Runs `npx knex migrate:latest` to ensure schema is up to date before tests.
- **Example Workflow:** See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for configuration (auto-created if missing).

**To enable:**
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions will run by default (see Actions tab).
3. Add secrets (if needed) for production deploys.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations

- Uses [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) for formal schema management.
- **Run migrations locally:**
  ```sh
  npx knex migrate:latest
  ```
- **Create a new migration:**
  ```sh
  npx knex migrate:make migration_name
  ```
- **Rollback:**
  ```sh
  npx knex migrate:rollback
  ```
- See `knexfile.js` for SQLite/Postgres/MySQL config. Default is SQLite (file-based, easy for dev).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set required secrets:
  - `MASTER_SECRET`, `API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, etc.
  - For on-chain anchoring: `MERCHANT_API_URL`, UTXO vars, or SmartLedger wallet vars.
- See `.env.example` and README Environment section for all options.
- Start server:
  ```sh
  node auth_api_production.js
  ```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Production Best Practices
- **Secrets:** Use a secrets manager or HSM in production. Never commit secrets to source control.
- **CORS:** Only allow trusted origins in production (see CORS config).
- **Rate Limiting:** Enabled by default, tune for your traffic.
- **JWT:** All sensitive endpoints require JWT authentication.
- **Chain of Custody:** Fully auditable, two-step transfer with cryptographic signatures.
- **Monitoring:** Winston logger supports log aggregation (Datadog, CloudWatch, etc).
- **Testing:** Run `npm test` for full integration coverage.

## üìñ API Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs available at [`/docs`](http://localhost:3000/docs) when running the server.
- See `openapi.yaml` for full endpoint specs.

---

## üí∏ Funding Abstraction & Extensibility
- The broadcast logic is fully abstracted: rotate funding keys, support multiple sources, or plug in a wallet service/API with minimal code changes.
- SmartLedger wallet integration is recommended for production.
